# TeamMood

**The Story**

Hi, Farza here. In July 2017 I launched a site I made called mood.gg. It was side project, and I expected some people to like it. What I didn't expect was for it to to get *front page* of Reddit, *18.2k* upvotes, and over *2 million hits* within 2 days. 

Originally for League of Legends, mood.gg played music according to the theme, personality, and playstyle of a *specifc* champion. For example, the champion "Jinx" is known to be insane and reckless so her playlist really fit this *mood*. With the help of some friends, we gave her songs like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gDch1p4c_M&list=PLcUMDJL7i_TIIb6K3BfLQKDs_KN4l92Yc&index=20) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUOVQ4KsX9U&index=34&list=PLcUMDJL7i_TIIb6K3BfLQKDs_KN4l92Yc). 

On release, it featured over 10,000 songs and 136 playlists where each playlist was correlated to a champion.

I also had a little "Join TeamMood" button at the top where you could drop me your resume. Originally, I was hoping some really good programmers or designers would apply to join me in my pursuit to create cool stuff. But, since mood.gg hit the front page of Reddit I had everyone from industry Software Engineers to a 13 y/o high school student from Morrocco apply. I didn't want to reject 95% of the people that applied because I truly felt that they were passionate and wanted to work with me to imporve their own skills and be part of something cool.
